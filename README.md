# Time Management Decision Support Tool

This project was created for MSCI 100: Management Engineering Concepts at the University of Waterloo.

Using this Excel VBA-powered tool, the user can create a digital schedule, track their sleep, meal prep, and navigate resources using interactive forms! Advice for better time management is outputted based on the user's schedule, which includes graphs/visualizations and recommended hours per week spent on each task.

An instructions sheet is provided within the tool for more details on how to navigate it.
